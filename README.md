## Problem Statement
The problem statement and the objective of this project is to create a visualizer that helps users understand and learn. The focus on visualizing the computer network algorithms that are the greedy algorithms Edmonds Karp and Capacity Scaling algorithms which are Ford Fulkerson type algorithms. These algorithms help to find the max-flow through the given network by the user. After studying about a few visualizers available on the internet we have come down on some key points that a visualizer must have that becomes handy and easy for the users to learn and enhance their imagination.

Some of the visualizers available on the internet are too good for learning without any doubt but there are some who are good in calculating the solution and some are good in providing the information to the user. The project has  come up with an idea of a finest system that is a visualizer for learning about the network flow algorithms in a very user interactive and friendly way. After taking inspiration from some finest visualizers we have developed our below listed project.   


## Introduction
The following project is to visualize the Computer Network Algorithm.The project consists of a user interactive web application which will take input from the user and form a user defined graph using simple mouse clicks and drags. The graph will consist of nodes, edges and their weights as given by the user. The user selects the Algorithm to be visualized (here we work on Ford Fulkerson Algorithm and Capacity Scaling Algorithm) and selects the PLAY button to start the visualization. After the visualization is completed it will pop the required output for the algorithm (here the output will be the maximum flow through the network). Once the visualization is completed, users may close the app.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The maximum flow problem is one of the most fundamental problems in network flow theory and has been investigated extensively. The project sincerely discusses the Ford-Fulkerson method and Capacity Scaling method for maximum flow, analysed its algorithm and looked into an example. The user can implement this amazing method in various real world applications. The method has made it easy to solve several critical problems smoothly. This Application is a proof of concept. To be truly usable in a production environment a lot of improvements can be made.
